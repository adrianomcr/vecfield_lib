# vecfield_lib - matlab

Example vector field control codes for matlab

---------------------


### Requirements

Some plotting function of the examples use the matlab_lib. Follow the instruction in `https://github.com/adrianomcr/matlab_lib` to install it.




### Main scripts

- `distance_field_2d.m`: Exemplify a vector field in 2d. Click on the image to simulate a trajectory. Right click to finish.

- `distance_field_3d.m`: Exemplify a vector field in 3d. Some randon initial conditions will be drawn to simulate trajectories.
